# Consignment Note & Job Card Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the Consignment Note and Job Card doctypes for the Snelex Frappe/ERPNext application, including all the requested features and enhancements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Consignment Note Doctype
**Location**: `snelex/snelex/doctype/consignment_note/`

#### Core Features:
- **Submittable Document**: Full workflow support (Draft → Submitted → Cancelled)
- **Auto-naming**: Uses series `CN-.YYYY.-` for automatic numbering
- **Dynamic Locations**: Integration with ERPNext Location doctype for from/to locations
- **Payment Types**: Three options - Shipper, Receiver, 3rd Party
- **Three-tab Interface**: Shipper Details, Consignee Details, Delivery Details

#### Key Fields:
- **Basic Info**: Naming series, consignment date, tracking number, locations, payment type
- **Invoiced To Section**: Auto-populated based on payment type selection
- **Shipper Details**: Links to Supplier with auto-population of contact details
- **Consignee Details**: Links to Customer with auto-population of contact details
- **Delivery Details**: Separate delivery contact information
- **Shipment Details**: Cartons, bundles, pieces, pallets, bags with auto-calculated totals
- **Description & Remarks**: Rich text fields for additional information

#### Auto-population Logic:
- **Payment by Shipper**: Invoiced To auto-fills with Shipper details
- **Payment by Receiver**: Invoiced To auto-fills with Consignee details  
- **Payment by 3rd Party**: Invoiced To remains blank for manual entry

#### Validation Rules:
- From/To locations cannot be the same
- Payment-specific validations (Shipper requires Supplier, Receiver requires Customer)
- At least one shipment detail required for submission
- Auto-calculation of total pieces

### 2. Job Card Doctype
**Location**: `snelex/snelex/doctype/job_card/`

#### Core Features:
- **Submittable Document**: Full workflow support
- **Auto-naming**: Uses series `JOB-.YYYY.-` for automatic numbering
- **Consignment Note Integration**: Can only be created from submitted Consignment Notes
- **Status Tracking**: Job Status (Open, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- **Advance Status**: Open/Closed tracking

#### Key Fields:
- **Basic Info**: Job date, consignment note reference, status fields
- **Job Details**: Description, special instructions, delivery dates, priority
- **Auto-populated from Consignment Note**: All shipper, consignee, and shipment details
- **Editable Fields**: Job description, special instructions, dates, priority, remarks

#### Integration Features:

### 3. Print Format
**Location**: `snelex/snelex/print_format/consignment_note_print/`

#### Features:
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, organized design matching reference image
- **Conditional Sections**: Only displays sections with data
- **Signature Areas**: Spaces for shipper, carrier, and consignee signatures
- **Print Optimization**: Proper page breaks and print-friendly styling
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different paper sizes

### 4. JavaScript Enhancements

- **Payment Type Logic**: Dynamic field requirements based on payment selection

### 5. Server-side Methods

#### Consignment Note Methods:
- `get_supplier_details(supplier)`: Returns supplier contact information
- `get_customer_details(customer)`: Returns customer contact information

#### Job Card Methods:
- `create_job_card_from_consignment_note(consignment_note)`: Creates Job Card from CN
- `get_consignment_note_details(consignment_note)`: Returns CN details for population

### 6. Validation & Business Logic

#### Consignment Note Validations:
